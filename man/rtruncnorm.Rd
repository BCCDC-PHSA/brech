\title{Sample from a Truncated Normal Distribution}
\usage{
rtruncnorm(n, mean, sd, low, high)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of samples to draw.}

\item{low}{Numeric. Lower truncation bound.}

\item{high}{Numeric. Upper truncation bound.}

\item{mu}{Numeric. Mean of the normal distribution.}

\item{sigma}{Numeric. Standard deviation of the normal distribution.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{n} containing random draws from the truncated normal distribution.
}
\description{
Generates random samples from a normal distribution truncated between
specified lower and upper bounds.
}
\details{
The function uses inverse transform sampling by first computing the
cumulative probabilities corresponding to the lower and upper bounds, then
sampling uniformly from this range and transforming back via the normal quantile function.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
