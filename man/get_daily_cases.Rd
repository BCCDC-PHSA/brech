\title{Compute Daily Incident Cases from Cumulative Simulation Output}
\usage{
get_daily_cases(r)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{A data frame or matrix with columns \code{"time"} and \code{"C"}, representing
time (in continuous units) and cumulative number of cases, respectively.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\describe{
\item{day}{Integer day values from the floor of the minimum time to the ceiling of the maximum time}
\item{daily_incidence}{Number of new cases per day, computed as the difference in interpolated cumulative cases}
}
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame or matrix containing irregularly spaced simulation
time points and cumulative case counts (\code{C}), and returns the number of new cases
per day using linear interpolation.
}
\details{
Since simulation outputs may record cumulative cases at non-integer time points,
this function performs linear interpolation to estimate cumulative cases at each
whole-number day. It then computes the number of incident cases as the first difference
of the interpolated values. The first day is assigned 0 new cases by default.
}
\examples{
sim_data <- as.matrix(dplyr::tibble(
  time = c(0, 0.1, 0.9, 1.4, 2.3, 3.8),
  C = c(0, 1, 5, 7, 10, 15)
))
get_daily_cases(sim_data)
