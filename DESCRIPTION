Description: The rapid construction and prototyping of stochastic infectious disease 
  models in small (~100 individuals) to medium (~1000 individuals) size settings. 
  The package includes tools for defining model parameters, rates, and initial 
  conditions along with model fitting and scenario projections. This ease of 
  construction does come at the cost of computational efficiency and so would not 
  be recommended for larger settings or with more complicated dynamics with multiple rates.
